You have updated to the new version of 《Working Timer》

The application is a simple timing tool, and only one timer can exist at a time.

In the new version, you can create a folder on the left side (click the button in the lower left corner to call out) to classify the timer.

You can check the timer history of the current folder on the right (click the button in the lower right corner to call out).

There is no *pause* in the timer. Once stopped, it will be recorded under the currently selected folder. You can view the currently selected folder name at the bottom of the interface.
